# Providence Badge Firmware

Rust firmware for the PY32F002A-based Providence Badge.

## Current Features

- Drives two 4-pin charlieplex LED banks:
  - pink hour ring on `PA0..PA3`
  - white half-step ring on `PA4`, `PA5`, `PA6`, `PA8`
- Implements Stop-mode sleep with PB0 wake:
  - PB0 is expected to have an external pullup and button-to-ground
  - firmware wakes for about 1 hour
  - pressing PB0 while awake returns to sleep
- Uses low-power Stop configuration:
  - low-power regulator enabled
  - 1.0 V Stop-mode voltage scaling
  - reduced SRAM retention voltage
- Provides a 5 second flash rescue window after reset.
  - Hold PB0 during reset to keep the firmware awake for flashing/debug.
- Includes a layout/SVG-based LED index workflow:
  - `../layout.json` is the source layout
  - `../led-layout.svg` marks LED positions, colors, and indexes
- Current animation test:
  - rotating 4-pink-LED cross for about 2 seconds
  - white LEDs with layout indexes `14`, `15`, `20`, `21` for 2 seconds
  - 6 seconds dark

## Build

```sh
cargo +nightly build --release
```

## Flash

```sh
./flash.sh
```

If the target is hard to attach to, wake it with PB0 or hold PB0 during reset. As a last resort:

```sh
CONNECT_UNDER_RESET=1 ./flash.sh
```

## Logs

```sh
probe-rs attach --chip PY32F030x8 target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/blobbadge-fw
```

## LED brigtness notes

The schematic of the bug badge is direct IO-LED connection. No resistor in series.
This isn't done according to best practices, but we can get away with this, as the
circuit is very simple. Also, in theory, PWMing LEDs gives us a bit more optimal
usage of the battery juice.

2 bottom LED pairs should be green, 2 top should be pink.

Green: ~2V
Pink: ~2.8V
